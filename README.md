24HourVirus
===========

This was a simple virus made by me for learning purposes. All in 24 hours.

This virus relies on few exploits. One it relies on replacing two existing system calls (open and close) with the open.o and close.o calls.
The virus attaches itself to a host that requires a file argument and then injects itself into the file. To stop the spread I designed it to not spread to any executable inputs. This virus also requires that the user execute the given infected host. I wanted to understand how viruses spread now a days and this project gave me great insight into the project.


ToDo
====
Update x86_64 for Mac OS X


Considerations:
===============
As always have fun use at your own risk and don't blame me if things don't work. This is just a side project for learning.
If you actually need help with anything feel free to contact me and I'll gladly try to help. I am sublicensing this under
